          <li><strong>From Self-Interest to Self-Sacrifice:</strong> Your evolution from a cynical arms dealer to the universe's ultimate protector was a masterclass in character development. You showed us that true heroism isn't about being perfect, but about striving to be better.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Architect of the MCU: </strong>Without your initial arc, the entire tapestry of the MCU might never have woven together so seamlessly. You were the foundation, the starting point, and the guiding light for so many other heroes.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong> The Unparalleled Wit:</strong> Your quick jabs, sarcastic remarks, and brilliant comebacks brought laughter and levity to even the darkest moments. You were the king of the one-liner, always ready with a quip.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>A Flawed Yet Relatable Hero:</strong> You weren't a god or a super-soldier; you were a man grappling with your own demons, anxieties, and the weight of the world. This vulnerability made your heroism all the more impactful.          </li>
          <li>
<strong>The Father Figure:</strong> From Peter Parker to the Avengers themselves, you often took on a mentorship role, guiding and protecting those you cared about. Your bond with Peter was especially touching, embodying a paternal love.          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Innovation and Ingenuity Personified:</strong> You constantly pushed the boundaries of technology, creating incredible suits and solutions that often saved the day. Your intelligence was truly a superpower in itself.          </li>
          <li>
<strong>The Man Behind the Armor: </strong>We saw glimpses of the vulnerable man beneath the suit, the one haunted by his past and driven by a desire to make a difference. This depth made us care deeply for you.          </li>
          <li>
<strong>"I Am Iron Man."</strong> That iconic line, both at the beginning and the end, bookended a phenomenal journey. It was a declaration of identity, a promise, and ultimately, a final, heroic sacrifice.          </li>
          <li>
<strong>The Ultimate Sacrifice:</strong> Your snap to save the universe was the most profound act of love and selflessness imaginable. You paid the ultimate price, ensuring a future for everyone, including your beloved Morgan.          </li>
          <li>
<strong>"We Love You 3000":</strong> This simple phrase, spoken by your daughter, became the enduring symbol of the love and admiration we all felt for you. It encapsulated the emotional core of your story and solidified your place in our hearts forever.          </li>
